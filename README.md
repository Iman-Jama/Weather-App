## <u>How it works</u>

I have developed an online weather application called Forecastly. When you visit my website, you'll immediately notice a convenient search bar, enabling you to effortlessly find the weather details for any city of your choice.

Upon entering a city name and initiating the search, you'll be greeted with a comprehensive display of weather information. Not only will you receive the current weather conditions for your selected city, but you'll also gain access to a detailed forecast for the upcoming five days. Our app presents the following essential aspects of the weather:

<ol>
<li>Temperature: Get the precise temperature reading for the city you searched.</li>
<li>Humidity: Discover the humidity level, providing insights into the moisture content of the air.</li>
<li>Windspeed: Stay informed about the wind's velocity, aiding in planning outdoor activities or assessing wind-related conditions.</li>
<li>Current Weather Icon: A visual representation of the current weather conditions in the form of an icon, allowing for quick and intuitive comprehension.</li>
</ol>
With Forecastly, you can stay one step ahead of the weather conditions, making informed decisions and ensuring a seamless experience wherever you go

## <u>Technologies used</u>

**JavaScript:** The main programming language used for developing the weather app's logic and interactivity.

**HTML:** The standard markup language utilized for structuring the web pages and content of the weather app.

**OpenWeatherMap API:** Integration with the OpenWeatherMap API allows the weather app to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather data for various locations.

**Tailwind CSS:** The Tailwind CSS framework was used to streamline the styling and layout of the weather app's user interface. It offers a utility-first approach and facilitates quick development with pre-defined CSS classes.

**Custom CSS Styling:** Alongside Tailwind CSS, custom CSS styling has been applied to enhance the visual appeal and tailor the aesthetics of the weather app according to specific requirements.

**DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation techniques have been utilized to dynamically update the weather app's interface based on user interactions and retrieved data.

These technologies work together to provide the functionality, presentation, and user experience of your weather app. They contribute to creating a seamless and visually appealing interface, ensuring users can interact with the app easily and enjoy a pleasant experience.
