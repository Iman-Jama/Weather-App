# Weather-App

## How it works:

I have a created an online weather APP. When you go the website, you will see a search bar, where you can search for any city. 

Once, you type in a city name and click search, you will be presented with the current weather for that city and the weather for the next 5 days in the searched city. You will be presented with the following aspects of the weather:

<ol>
<li>The temperature</li>
<li>The humidity</li>
<li>The windspeed</li>
<li>An icon showing the current weather</li>
</ol>
